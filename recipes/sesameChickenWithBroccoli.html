    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This stir-fried sesame chicken with broccoli has the classic, sweet, slightly spicy flavor you expect, but is also loaded with fresh broccoli florets. Serve with white or brown rice, or your favorite Asian noodles.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle with cornstarch, salt, and white pepper. Toss chicken to coat evenly and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon cooking oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, sambal oelek, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet or wok until very hot. Add chicken pieces carefully to the hot oil. Cook, stirring, until chicken pieces are lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes total. The chicken pieces will cause spattering, so be sure to use a long-handled spoon or other utensil to move the chicken around.</li>
    </ol>
